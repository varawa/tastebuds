//  Optional Chaining ?.

//  props = properties .
//  props are passed as arguments in the functional component on their own .

//  JSX curly braces do support embedding JavaScript expressions, 
//  but they do not support JavaScript statements like for loops directly. 
//  JavaScript expressions return a value, whereas statements perform an action. Hereâ€™s the difference:

//  Expressions are things like 2 + 2, myArray.map(...), or restaurant.name.
//  Statements are things like if conditions, for loops, and while loops.


//  ONE WAY DATA-BINDING

//  React uses one-way data binding .


//  What is State ?
//  What is Hook ? -functions
//  What is useState ?

//useState is a hook .

//[searchText , setSearchText] destructured the array returned by useState .
//React doesnt have "Two Way Data Binding" .

//useState() hooks are used to create local state variables in react .

//Why do we need state variables?

//React has one way binding, also react does not keep track of changes made in local variables ,
//but it keeps track of state variables .

//Two Parameters of useEffect : 1. callback function 2. Dependency Array .
//Dependency array decides on what event will useEffect be called .(Called only once when dependency array is empty .)
//useEffect is called after first render when dependency array is EMPTY .
//useEffect is called after every render when dependency array is no passed as a parameter .
//When dependency array is not empty then its called after every re-render(only those re-renders where the concerned dependency is changed) .

//The call-back function inside useEffect is not called immediately but called only when useEffect wants it to be called .

//Conditional Rendering .
//If(restaurant === empty) => load shimmer UI
//if it has data then load actual UI .


//MicroServices ?
//We have small projects for every small component (UI , API , Notifications , Logs , Authentication) .
//And every component (small project) can run on different ports and can have different databases that they rely on .

//How these are connected ?
//All the ports are mapped to eachother and in majority cases have the same domain name .

//Seperation of concern (SOC) .

//Monolith ?

//Why is CDN a good way to host images ?
